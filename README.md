# Weekly Game Jam Week 167
# Theme: Pass The Torch

## Game Overview

A little puzzle about guiding a torch to the exit of a dungeon. With every step your fuel is depleted, so be diligent about your path!

This game will have an initial deployment on Itch.io with a WebGL and a Mac native deployment.
 
## Player Experience

There are no time limits on the game. The level only ends if the player runs out of steps, or reaches the exit.
